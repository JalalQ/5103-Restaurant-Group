# Introduction

This project was completed as part of the Javascript course group-project (total of 5 members). I was the **lead designer** of the project, and set-up the 
global CSS file, restaurant icon (top-left), navigatinal drop-down menu, and footer which all my other group members used on their pages.

In this project, I was respnsible for the design of the home page and the contact us feature. For the contact us feature, the input data values were validated
so that the user does not submit non-nullable fields as empty.

## Specification Testing
To evaluate the requirements and QA considerations of a web page specification, I also conducted a specification testing for the form submission feature and wrote the [Specification Document](https://github.com/JalalQ/RestaurantProject/blob/master/Specification-Testing.pdf).
